Programming Background

My favorite program I wrote in CS 165 was called Guess the Number. The program randomly
selected a number between 1 and 100. The user would make a guess and the program would return
one of the follwing responses:
- Correct!
- My number is higher.
- My number is lower.


My hobbies:
ice hockey
snowboarding
